Project 2025 keeps being modified.  Minor changes were noticed from a copy from only a week ago of the Project 2025 mandate downloaded directly from project2025.org:
https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf

Upon closer inspection going back to earlier copies of the Project 2025 mandate, it was apparent that the file size has decreased by 18 percent over the past 6 months.  As well every single one of the 922 pages contained in the PDF has been modified to some degree or another in that time frame.  The included copies of the mandate in these branches were manually downloaded from the above URI however these changes to the content and their corresponding file checksums align and can be verified through independent sources such as archive.org:
https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf

The question is what are they changing and why?
Are they trying to hide things now that the project is receiving too much press?  Is it in the service of disinformation and discrediting critics intentionally shifting and changing the entire text so references by page number and even specific quotes aren't verifiable?  Or is it just the fact that these right-wing think tanks involved are just slapping this together as quickly as they can while continuously polishing this turd.
